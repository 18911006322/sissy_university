        <h1>Intro:</h1>
        <p class="text-left">
            Sissy University 2018 is a longterm game which explores various sexual kinks. You’ll get to
            choose a major focusing on one or more of fields and build up a daily schedule of kinky tasks. The game is
            designed so that it doesn’t intervene too much with your daly life and only requires
            between 10 and 60 minutes of commitment per day. There are multiple routes, each focusing on different
            things
            such as "anal and prostate play", "feminization and chastity", "bondage and orgasm denial", "oral and anal
            play" and "body fluids and enemas".
            There are extra options featuring a variety of fetishes such as latex clothing, bondage,
            inflation, spanking, breathplay, humiliation, petplay, estim, fucking machines, sensory deprivation,
            mummification and others.
        </p>
        <h1>How to play:</h1>
        <h5 class="text-center">Major, major path and mandatory classes</h5>
        <p class="text text-left">
            Choose a major depending on what you'd like to specialise in. Every major has specific mandatory classes
            (prerequisites) and each of those classes has prerequisite classes of their own. Keep in mind that you need
            to complete a minimum of 5 Core (Red), 4 Base (yellow), 3 Advanced (green) and 2 Master (blue) classes
            before attempting to graduate. Your mandatory classes will cover some of those numbers. You’ll have to
            choose which
            extra ones to take yourself. Once you sign up for a major you'll be able to see your mandatory classes in
            the Progress page. They'll stay there even after completion. Don't worry, you need to complete them only
            once.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-center">Weekly schedule, class attendance and exams</h5>
        <p class="text text-left">
            Every class has a weekly schedule that you need to keep track of. You’ll need to complete one of the two
            daily tasks to count as attendance. If you fail to attend a class by the end of the day a punishment will be
            automatically rolled for that class.
            If you want to pass a class you need to attend it at least once. Once
            you attend it, you can try to pass it the next time you have the class in question. Skipping a class in any
            way (normal skip or using a club perk) does NOT count as attendance. You can NOT pass classes if you have
            pending punishments. You’ll have two
            exam options to choose from. If you fail to do your exam task or your daily task, press the corresponding
            button to get punished. Once you pass a class you can immediately enroll in
            another one if you wish. You can not enroll in more than 4 classes (unless stated otherwise). Do not enroll
            in too many classes at once if you can’t keep up with the schedule.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-center">Punishments</h5>
        <p class="text text-left">
            If you fail to attend a class by the end of the day, do one of the daily tasks or fail an exam you must
            press the corresponding button to roll a random punishment. You can see the full list of punishments in the
            Punishments page. Your punishments can be seen in the Progress page and completed from the Schedule page.
            You can complete your punishments whenever you like. You can get a maximum of 5
            punishments (unless stated otherwise). You can’t pass classes or graduate if you have any pending
            punishments, so make sure you don’t stack too many of them.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-center">Clubs</h5>
        <p class="text text-left">
            You can join (and leave) a club of your choosing. While they are not mandatory they let you skip classes.
            You can skip a maximum of 3 classes using club perks every day (unless stated otherwise). Some clubs require
            extra items and outfits. To gain uses of the clubs’ perks simply do one of the required club activities. For
            every club activity done you get one perk use corresponding to that activity. This means that doing Club
            Activity 1 grants you one use of Perk 1. You can stack as many perk uses as activities you have done. Perk
            uses are stored and can be used later. Activities can be done on any day of the week. Choose a club
            depending on your major and interests. Some clubs become very useful later on. Leaving a club will reset all
            of
            your perks and club activities.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-center">Graduating</h5>
        <p class="text text-left">
            Once you have completed all your major’s prerequisite classes and those classes’ prerequisite classes,
            completed the required number of core/base/advanced/master classes, completed all your current classes and
            done all of your pending punishments, you may attempt to
            graduate. Some Majors could take up to a month for the final task. If you fail to do one of the thesis
            requirements you must press the fail button which will roll a maximum number of punishments (usually 5).
            After completing them you can try to graduate again. The game ends when you complete your final thesis.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-center">Other</h5>
        <p class="text text-left">
            - Buttplugs and chastity devices may be remove at any time for sanitation or health reasons. Don’t abuse
            this. <br>
            - All toy sizes are minimums, feel free to use larger ones if you want. Buttplug diameter is measured at the
            widest part <br>
            - Anal tasks can be considered as done if you cum from anal, unless stated otherwise.<br>
            - You can do multiple workloads (tasks, exams, punishments, clubs) at once (if possible). <br>
            - You are free to masturbate and cum after your daily workload is done unless stated otherwise. If you’re
            locked in chastity you’re allowed to cum only from anal.<br>
            - Some exam tasks could take more than a day. If you are currently doing an exam task for a class and get
            that class in your daily schedule, you can simply press the button to complete your daily task.<br>
            *note than daily task, exam task and daily workload are different things.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-center">Game terms:</h5>
        <p class="text text-left">
            <b class="text-left">WORKLOAD</b> - means your total work for the day. Includes daily class tasks, exams,
            punishments and club
            activities. <br>
            <span> </span>
            <b>DRESSED LIKE A GIRL</b> – means wearing a bra, panties, stockings/pantyhose, heels and a skirt/dress.
            You
            can wear them under your normal clothes if you want. (Wig/makeup optional) <br>
            <b>FULL SISSY ATTIRE</b> – means "dressed as a girl" and wearing a chastity device and a buttplug as a
            bonus.
            Wig and minimal makeup are mandatory.
            Plug has to be of size M or larger, unless stated otherwise by a task/punishment/club activity.<br>
            <b>APPLY CLOTHESPINS TO YOUR BALLS AND NIPPLES</b> – 2 clothespins for your nipples (1 on each) and 4
            clothespins on your balls. <br>
            <b>PET</b> – Put some animal ears/mask on and a tail buttplug. Use a normal buttplug if you don’t have one
            with a tail. Walk on all fours. <br>
            <b>BITCH</b> – Put on animal ears/mask, insert an anal tail (or a butplug size L if you don’t have one)
            and
            lock yourself in chastity. Tie your hands and legs in a “bitch suit/petplay” position so you walk on your
            elbows
            and knees. You can use pads to reduce discomfort. See illustrations below. The two ways that I have
            personally found to do this are:<br>
            - Tie each one of your legs (ankle to hip) first. You can use either a rope, a belt or shorts. Just get a
            pair of shorts that are wider at the knees and instead puting them on normally, bend each leg at the knee
            and put the pants on these way, through your knees. You won't be able to pull through your whole leg like
            this at it'll get tighter the further you go, effectively restraining your legs.<br>
            - Then tie/cuff you hands (i use a double cinch noose) and put the rope behind your neck. Another way is the
            tshirt method. Start putting on a tshirt but instead of pulling your arms through normally, bend them by the
            elbow and pull them through the elbows and then pull the shirt down through your head and neck. <br>
            - Both of these methods are easy to do and to get out of so no real danger.
